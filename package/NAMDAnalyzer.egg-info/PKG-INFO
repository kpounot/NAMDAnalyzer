Summary: # NAMDAnalyzer
Python based routines for molecular dynamics simulation analysis from NAMD


## Installation:

### Unix and Windows
To install it within your python distribution, use 

    make [build] (for openMP version) or [build_cuda] (for CUDA accelerated version - recommended) 
    make install

or
    
    python setup.py [build, build_cuda]
    python setup.py install


## Start the interpreter:
Initialization of the ipython console can be done using the following command:

    ipython -i <path to NAMDAnalyzer.py> -- <list of files to be loaded> [-s stride]

### Options: 

- -s stride -> use to skip frames when loading a .dcd file. For instance if "-s 5" is provided, 
only the frames that are multiples of 5 will be loaded.

## Usage:
The program is organized on a master class contained in NAMDAnalyzer.Dataset.

#### Open and plot log file data
To analyze log file, the following can be used:

``` python
import NAMDAnalyzer as nda

data = nda.Dataset('20190326_fss_tip4p_prelax.out') #_Import log file

#_Another log file can be append to the imported one using data.logData.appendLOG() method  

#_To plot data series using keywords given in data.logData.etitle
data.logData.plotDataSeries('TEMP KINETIC TOTAL')
```
